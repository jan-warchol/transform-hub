Scramjet is a fast, simple, functional reactive stream programming framework written on top of node.js object streams. The code is written by chaining functions that transform the streamed data, including well known map, filter and reduce and fully compatible with ES7 async/await. Thanks to it some built in optimizations scramjet is much faster and much much simpler than similar frameworks when using asynchronous operations.

The main advantage of scramjet is running asynchronous operations on your data streams. First of all it allows you to perform the transformations both synchronously and asynchronously by using the same API - so now you can "map" your stream from whatever source and call any number of API's consecutively. And if you're after some heavy maths there's an option of running your stream as multi-threaded!

To extend the usability of Scramjet, we decided to rewrite its functionality into the Python programming language. This is what is happening in this repository. Welcome to the new side of Scramjet, where its speed and functionality is revealed while streaming data in Python.

>_Tested with Python 3.8.10 and Ubuntu 20.04._

Most important methods :construction_worker:
----------------------

* `read_from` - create a new stream from an iterable or an object implementing .read() method.
* `map` - transform each chunk in a stream using specified function.
* `filter` - keep only chunks for which specified function evaluates to `True`.
* `to_list` - write all resulting stream chunks into a list.
* `reduce` - combine all chunks using specified function.


Examples :books:
--------

Take a look at `hello_world_datastream.py` file. You can run it with:

    python hello_world_datastream.py


Running tests :chart_with_upwards_trend:
-------------

Create and activate a virtualenv:

    sudo apt install python3-virtualenv
    virtualenv -p python3 venv
    . venv/bin/activate

Check Python version:

    $ python --version
    Python 3.8.10

Install libraries:

    pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

Run test cases (with activated virtualenv):

    pytest

> :bulb: **HINT:** add a filename if you want to limit which tests are run

If you want to enable detailed debug logging, set one of the following env variables:

```python
PYFCA_DEBUG=1       # debug pyfca
DATASTREAM_DEBUG=1  # debug datastream
SCRAMJET_DEBUG=1    # debug both
```

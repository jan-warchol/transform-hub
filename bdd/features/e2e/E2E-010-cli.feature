Feature: CLI tests

This feature checks CLI functionalities

# @one-session tag was added in order to start a set of test in one session(one testing process), they are based on the same Host started in BeforeAll() step and require to set config only once. That is why step "Then I set format json in config" is added only once -> in the first scenario.
# If you want to test a single scenario, step: "Then I set format json in config" must be added after "Given host is running" step in this particular scenario you want to test.
